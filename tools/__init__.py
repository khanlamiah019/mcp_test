"""
MCP Tools Package

This package contains shared framework tools.
Students should create their own tools in their personal directories (e.g., team1a/scarlett/).

Note: STAC tools have been moved to team1a/scarlett/stac_tools.py as an example
of student-developed tools. Import them directly from that location.
